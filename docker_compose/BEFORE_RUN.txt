Before you run docker-compose you need to

Memory used:  8GB of RAM

1) Install docker-compose and give it enough memory
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
echo 'vm.max_map_count=262144' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/60-vm-max_map_count.conf

2) Run the following commands to store the FormShare data outside the docker containers
sudo mkdir /opt/formshare
whoami=$(whoami)
sudo chown $whoami /opt/formshare
mkdir /opt/formshare/celery
mkdir /opt/formshare/log
mkdir /opt/formshare/repository
mkdir /opt/formshare/config
mkdir /opt/formshare/mysql
mkdir /opt/formshare/elasticsearch
mkdir /opt/formshare/elasticsearch/esdata
mkdir /opt/formshare/elasticsearch/esdata2
mkdir /opt/formshare/elasticsearch/esdata3

3) Edit the docker-compose.yml to change:
-The mysql security credentials:
line 8: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: my_secure_password
line 77: MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD: my_secure_password

-The admin credentials:
line 78: FORMSHARE_ADMIN_USER: admin
line 79: FORMSHARE_ADMIN_EMAIL: admin@myserver.com
line 80: FORMSHARE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: my_secure_password

4) Run docker compose
cd formshare/docker_compose
sudo docker-compose up

Docker will pull the necessary images and run FormShare. After all images are pulled and
all services run, you will be able to access FormShare at http://localhost:5900/formshare.
From there you can poxy pass it using Apache.
